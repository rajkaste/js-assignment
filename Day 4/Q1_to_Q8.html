  <h3>Question 6:</h3>
  <h4>Rewrite the function using '?' or '||'
Write a loop which prompts for a number greater than 100. If the visitor enters another number – ask them
to input again.
The loop must ask for a number until either the visitor enters a number greater than 100 or cancels the
input/enters an empty line.
Here we can assume that the visitor only inputs numbers. There’s no need to implement a special
handling for a non-numeric input in this task.</h4>

  <h3>Question 7:</h3>
  <h4>An integer number greater than 1 is called a prime if it cannot be divided without a remainder by anything
except 1 and itself.
In other words, n > 1 is a prime if it can’t be evenly divided by anything except 1 and n.
For example, 5 is a prime, because it cannot be divided without a remainder by 2, 3 and 4.
Write the code which outputs prime numbers in the interval from 2 to n.
For n = 10 the result will be 2,3,5,7.
P.S. The code should work for any n, not be hard-tuned for any fixed value </h4>
